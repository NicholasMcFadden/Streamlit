                Data and analytics have always been a large part of my career. However, my time in corporate strategy/consulting has solidified that the requirements for long term growth 
                will be highly correlated with oneself's ability to adopted new technology. When I started out in finance, having advanced Microsoft Excel ability made you ahead of the rest, then it was knowing SQL. 
                I saw this digital skills inflation happening right before my eyes.  \n''')

                That is why as a Data Scientist I can improve my technical and analytical skills while being able to leverage my extensive previous work history to translate business needs into technical
                analysis/requirements more effectively. \nThis is where I believe my talents will be best suited, at the interesection of: relationship building, communication, project management, and technical skills.  I am a naturally very curious person and Data Science in particular is exciting because at
                 its core it's using advanced methods/mathematics/technology to improve our understanding of the world around us. \n ''')

                That is when I chose to go to Syracuse University for their Masters of Science in Business Analytics(MSBA). I decided to complete the MSBA rather than just the MS in Data Science because at the forefront I wanted
                to make sure the skills I was learning tied back to bringing value to the business. While in the program, I really began to love and see the importance of learning the more advanced technical aspects of Data Science. 
                Luckily, the MSBA was a larger degree to achieve than the MS in Data Science degree at Syracuse. Therefore, I was able to arange the classes I took to take all of the same classes from the MS in Data Science degree
                in addition to the extra MSBA specific classes.\n

                They wouldn't let me double major without paying for two degrees soooo.....the Certificate of Advanced Study(CAS) in Data Science is a fair consolation ðŸ˜‚!

                The Syracuse program gave me a great foundation in the Data Science/Business Analytics and now I want to apply these additional skills.  \n
                I am currently looking for opportunites in Data Science/Data & Business Analytics fields, ideally with a machine learning/artificial intelligence focus. 
                If you or someone you know, are looking to hire for a position in this field and/or need someone with my skill set PLEASE reach out --here--!! \n

                Please take the time to review the projects in this Streamlit Portfolio App and you can find more project at my --Github--.
