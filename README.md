# Streamlit Apps

Building a Streamlit Web App to showcase some of my coding and data science projects.  

Building this app in itself is a project, how to use a tool like this to quickly deliver prototypes and MVPs. 

Currently:
  -Adding a Database (AWS S3)
  -Adding authentication service (AWS Cognito)
  -Upload more projects

User login pages will give access to more of my projects as a way to start building a community
